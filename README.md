# GNeural-Nets
A generalized neural net library, using only GA for training.
Each neuron can be connected with every other neuron, even with itself.

Classic FF network can be created using BuildFFNetwork.

GAGNN stands for Genetic Algorithm for Generalized Neural Networks.

GAGNN is used to train a network
